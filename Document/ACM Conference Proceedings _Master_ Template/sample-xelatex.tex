Network traffic is an important issue raised by the network that refers to 
the amount of data moving across a network at the given point of time. 
A capsulated network data called packet is the main component for the 
traffic measurement and the network traffic shows a significant potential
for the researchers to find a solution on the high speed communication 
system\ [?].  Several research works were conducted to transfer packets 
in high speed rate possibles and yet it is a challenging task.  In this research project, implementation of a network level compression link is considered. A network application to detect whether network compression is presented implemented. To validate the functionality, simulated compression link is designed and presented. In this research 
work, the focus was taken on the data compression approach to fully utilize 
the network when point to point network is a bottle neck. The design defined 
under under Microsoft  point to point protocol standard and network simulation 
(NS-3) environment were used for system design and implementation. 
A comprehensive data analysis and evaluation were conducted to observe 
network efficiency when compression is activated

\section{Introduction}
ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.

\section{Design Review}
High speed application become considerable especially when there is 
a high traffic in the network. In order to generate high traffic, a single topology 
with 5 nodes was designed and implemented using point to point protocol standard library in 
the NS-3 environment. Figure ? shows the topology designed in this project. 
The middle link was used to generate bottleneck link. First node and the last 
node act as client and server application where the sender sends two sets of 
6000 UDP packets back-to-back as packet train, and the receiver records the 
arrival time between the first and last packet in the train. The first packet train 
consists of all packets of size 1100 bytes in payload, filled with all 0’s, while the 
second packet train contains random sequence of bits. This configuration generates 
high traffic in the middle point to point link that makes it suitable environment to implement
data compression on top of the application.
 

\subsection{Data Compression}

 In order to fully utilize the network path especially in the bottleneck of the network 
 data compression is introduced. In this project zLib external library was implemented 
 to compress data in pre-link path. zlib [?] is a software library used for data compression 
 and is an abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in their gzip file 
 compression program. zlib is also a crucial component of many software platform as 
 the compressed data format is itself portable across platforms.
The compression link application was embedded and built using NS-3. 
The implemented Lempel-Ziv-Stac [?] compression algorithm is  responsible for 
compression and decompression of incoming and outgoing packets and follows 
RFC 1974 PPP Stac LZS Compression Protocol [?] requirement.
 
 
 
For the purposes of this project, the entire packets are inspected upon the arrival for checking the protocol number.  Matched protocol packet then is pushed for compression process. The pre-processing  finds the matched packet to replace the original protocol number with the LZS protocol number, 0x4021. Original protocol number is appended to the original data, and compress that whole bit-string and replace it with the original data section in the original packet, as illustrated in Figure 1. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Topology}
  \caption{Designed 5 nodes topology with point-to-point compression link }
\end{figure}

In the other hand, decompressor, at the other side of the compression link then reverse all the pre-processing steps performed at the compressor, to retrieve the original incoming packet, before pushing it to the next interface. The assumption is the two routers have already reached an Opened state and LZS has been negotiated as the primary compression algorithm. Similarly, there is no implementation from the negotiation phase specified in X3.241-1994. The compression and decompression algorithm is implemented in PointToPointNetDevice to enable compression/decompression on point-to-point links in NS-3 environment. The higher level of compression and decompression implementation model is shown below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{compression}
  \caption{he specified method to implement for assembling compressed packets, as specified in RFC 1974[?] }
\end{figure}


\subsection{Compression Detection Algorithm}
The network compression detection is implemented only in the cooperative environment as described. The proposed network application is implemented as a client/server application where the sender sends two sets of 6000 UDP packets as packet train one zero payload and the other random generated payload. The random sequence generator is implemented using /dev/random library in Linux. In order to detect compression, a threshold value is introduced. If the difference in arrival time between the first and last packets of the two trains is more than a fixed threshold 100 ms, the application reports Compression detected!, whereas when the time difference is less than 100 there was probably no compression link on the path and the application should display No compression was detected. Equation (1). 



The proposed compression algorithm is configured with one command-line argument, Compression Link Capacity, which specifies the maximum bandwidth across the link between the two routers. compression link capacity is tuned to find the compression efficiency.

\subsection{System Implementation}
As discussed earlier, the network topology was implemented in the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP – RFC 1661) [?] model library. The native PPP link is assumed to be stablished and authenticated at all the time. 




\subsection{Verification and Implementation}
The proposed project was run under a 5-node topology in NS-3 environment as shown in Figure ?. Nodes sender and receiver are the end-hosts running the network application. Nodes R1 and R2 are the intermediate routers where the link between them is compression-enabled. The project topology was built under NS-3 environment using point to point link library. It includes four logically separate simulations, each doing one of the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Transmit low entropy data over a network topology without a compression link.
\item Transmit high entropy data over a network topology without a compression link. 
\item Transmit low entropy data over a network topology with a compression link. 
\item Transmit high entropy data over a network topology with a compression link.
\end{itemize}

The middle capacity link (R1, R2) then varies and tuned with different capacity parameter from 1 to 10 Mbps, reporting each deltatH - deltatL. The link capacity of the two outer (non compression) links on the four node topology was set persistently to 5 Mbps.  Confounding variables across the four simulation nodes were controlled , as the timing between these four simulation types were ultimately comparing to detect the compression link. Proposed two senders in the topology supports low and high entropy respectively. Sender and receiver nodes are UDP server and clients. Receiver nodes records the arrival time between the first and last packet in the simulation. There are three main components designed and implemented in this architecture.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Configuration Management System
\item Topology Management System
\item Compression System
\item Synchronization and Output Recorder
\end{itemize}

protocol check, payload management, compression and decompression feature were hosted in the point-to-pont-net-device class library. The udp-client model class were modified to generate random payload in high entropy traffic and udp-server model class host the entire calculation and compression detection algorithm. The external zLib [?] - An abstract of the DEFLATE compression algorithm - was embed with project to perform compression task and as such output data length of compression link varied due to compression process.  
In order to build the project ./waf build system was implemented. the following command build the project while compression system is enabled. 
 
 waf command to build
 
 In topology management, two UDP client and an UDP server and point to point net devices were initiazed. The Initialized class implementation is shown for low entropy UDP Client. The device attribute for the link between router 1 and router 2 was set for data rate, delay and maximum transmit unit (MTU). The compression and decompression flag was set while initializing the topology. The point to point net device library was modified to support the following features: 
 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Protocol Checker
\item Payload Management
\item Compression and Decompression
\end{itemize}
 
 SEND method in point to point net device host compression design while RECEIVE method host Decompression design. The arriving PPP packets were parse to capture protocol and if protocol number matched with configuration management system. If checked packet type matches one in the configuration file, the payload will be taken and compressed based on zLib library. and the protocol will be replaced with LZS protocol number. and the newly generated packet will be sent to Decompression router through the link.  
 In the other hand, RECEIVE function decompressed the packet payload data after removing all necessary header file.  The designed system is smart to detect and to target only compressed packet for decompression process. Figure ? shows the header file involved with the arriving packet and the compression process on the packet. 
 
 Figure ?
 
Second UDP client is in-charge to generate high entropy trained packet and run it through the network. The same process will take place for high entropy trained packet. In the other hand, UDP server counts the incoming packets and calculates the delta high entropy and the delta low entropy based on the equation ?

Equation ? delta t H - delta t L 

To detect the compression threshold value of 100 ms was defined.  The delta time difference more than the threshold value triggers the detection flag and vice a versa. Timing report of the delta is logged and store in the repository.  
 
Client and server application where the senders send 6000 UDP packets and the receiver records the arrival time between the first and the last packet in the train . the first packet train consists of all packets of size 1100 bytes in their payload, filled with zeros while the second packet trains contains random sequence of bits. If the difference in arrival time between the first and last packets of the two trains is more than the fixed threshold of 100 ms, the application reports compression detected whilst when the time difference is less than the threshold value, there is probably no compression link in the path and the application reports no compression is detected. The middle link data rate was modified within the range of 1Mbps up to 10Mbps to generate bottleneck of data on the link. Figure ? shows the timing reported on link capacity while two outer link on the node topology was set to 8Mbps consistently.

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.
\item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}


The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.
\item{\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item{\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
\item{\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Template Parameters}

In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|anonymous,review|}: Suitable for a ``double-blind''
  conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
  numbers. Use with the \verb|\acmSubmissionID| command to print the
  submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
\item{\verb|authorversion|}: Produces a version of the work suitable
  for posting by the author.
\item{\verb|screen|}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\end{itemize}

This document uses the following string as the first command in the
source file:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
  modifications are discovered.}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

\section{Rights Information}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
document:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
\item the conference information in the page header(s).
\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
each of the works.

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for all short- and
full-length articles, and optional for two-page abstracts.

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{The 1907 Franklin Model D roadster.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should
{\bfseries also} include a description suitable for screen readers, to
assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}

  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
  book \cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
  symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
  \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
  \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
  \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
  doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
  \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
  \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
  \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and
  (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
  publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
  \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
  contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
  \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
  multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
  couple of citations with DOIs:
  \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
  citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}.

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
and subsection identification method.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
\item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
\end{itemize}

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{sample-base}

%% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
